About hgdc-x
============

hgdc-x is a cross-platform desktop client for the Hackathon Gunther Daemon music player project.
It requires you to be running an hgd server on your local network. The official github repository for the server can be found at https://github.com/vext01/hgd.

hgdc-x is a feature complete GUI client for hgd, including SSL encryption and administrative commands. It is written in cross-platform Lazarus/Freepascal and is designed to target Linux (GTK), Mac OS X (Carbon) and Windows (Win32). Other targets and widget sets, for example FreeBSD are possible but untested.


Building
========

hgdc-x will build with no additional libraries (except for synapse, which is statically linked and included in the source tree), with Lazarus 0.9.30 or later, which can be downloaded from the website at http://lazarus.freepascal.com


Binaries
========

Pre-compiled binaries and a Windows installer for each release are available from the "Downloads" tab above.
To use SSL you will need OpenSSL libraries installed.
On Windows, you can download the installer package which includes the OpenSSL libraries.

The offical website is at http://hgdcx.canthack.org, where an Ubuntu PPA for hgdc-x as well as the main hgd server project can be found.
