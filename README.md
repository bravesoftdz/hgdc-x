hgdc-x is a cross-platform desktop client for the Hackathon GÃ¼nther Daemon music player project.
The official github repository for the server can be found at https://github.com/vext01/hgd

It is a feature complete GUI client, including SSL encryption, written in Lazarus, and is designed to target Linux (GTK or QT) and Windows (Win32 or QT). Other targets, for example Mac OS X and FreeBSD are possible but untested.

It will build with no additional libraries (except for synapse, which is statically linked and included in the source tree), with Lazarus 0.9.30 or later.

Please refer to the COPYING file for licensing details.
