hgdcx for Debian
----------------

This is a feature complete HGD GUI client, including SSL encryption, written in Lazarus, and is designed to target Linux (GTK or QT), Mac OS X (Carbon) and Windows (Win32 or QT). Other targets, for example FreeBSD are possible but untested.

It will build with no additional libraries (except for synapse, which is statically linked and included in the source tree), with Lazarus 0.9.30 or later.
